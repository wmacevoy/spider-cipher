    The spider cipher is a cipher based on a deck of cards which is designed to be verifiable by a human. Try putting in a comma-separated sequence of cards in numeric form below (e.g. 3, 28, 6, 20, 33) along with a message, and hitting "Scramble!" Send it to a friend, and they can either take out a pen and paper or put it in here with the deck and hit "Unscramble!"
    <br /> <br />
    For a full explanation of how the cipher works, see <a href="#">here.</a> [Note: does not currently go anywhere]
    <br /> <br />
    Deck:
    <br />
    <input type="text" size=50 id="deck"></input>
    <br />
    Message (scrambled or unscrambled):
    <br />
    <input type="text" size=50 id="msg"></input>
    <br />
    <button onclick="pageScramble(scrambleMsg = true)">Scramble!</button>
    <button onclick="pageScramble(scrambleMsg = false)">Unscramble!</button>
    <button onclick="testScramble(scrambleMsg = true)">Unscramble!</button>    
  </body>
