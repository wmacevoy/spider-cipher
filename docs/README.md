## Cards

There is an automated build tool for building the svg and png files for the cards.

`./cards.py` uses cards-template.svg to build 00.svg .. 39.svg

`open cards.html` displays the cards in a grid for quick review (the fonts do not exactly match the export)

`./export` builds the cards and uses inkscape to create 600dpi images

The physical cards were made at boardgamemaker.com
