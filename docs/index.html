    The spider cipher is a cipher based on a deck of cards which is designed to be verifiable by a human. Try putting in a comma-separated sequence of cards in numeric form below (e.g. 3, 28, 6, 20, 33) along with a message, and hitting "Scramble!" Send it to a friend, and they can either take out a pen and paper or put it in here with the deck and hit "Unscramble!"
    <br /> <br />
    Only works with most ASCII right now. Should work with all text found on a standard qwerty keyboard. With minimal know-how, the source code can be modified to work with character sets 108 characters and smaller. Emoji are included, but their implementation is a little bit finicky, and the same is to be expected of all things that get encoded as multiple characters in a javascript string. Still, the emoji code should be able to act as a guideline if you know what you're doing.

    <br /> <br />
    Deck:
    <br />
    <input type="text" size=100 id="deck"></input>
    <br />
    Message (scrambled or unscrambled):
    <br />
    <input type="text" size=100 id="msg"></input>
    <br />
    <button onclick="pageScramble(scrambleMsg = true)">Scramble!</button>
    <button onclick="pageScramble(scrambleMsg = false)">Unscramble!</button>
    <button onclick="fillDeckWithDefault()">Fill in default deck</button>
    <br /> <br />
    <button onclick="runTests(tests, beLoud = true)">Run Tests</button> <-- Output in console (ctrl+shift+i) (beware: it's a lot! but it's pretty repetitive)
